# ChronoTell - Day Finder Web App
ChronoTell is a JavaScript-based web application that allows users to input any valid date (between the years 1600 to 3200) and instantly find out the day of the week for that specific date.

It uses the traditional odd days method from the Gregorian calendar system to compute results accurately without relying on any built-in JavaScript date libraries.
